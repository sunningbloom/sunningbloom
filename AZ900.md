## Describe Cloud Computing

### Define Cloud Computing
- Using someone else’s computer on demand to portal in and test applications and other services.

### Describe the Shared Responsibility Model
- How Microsoft and customers divide responsibilities, including security.
- Self-hosted servers: Full cycle of building security to data is the customer's responsibility.
- Azure takes over some responsibilities:
  - Building Security, Physical Network Security, Physical Computer Security.
  - Client responsibilities: OS, network, app settings, authentication, users, devices, and data.

- **Cloud App Service**:
  - Azure takes over OS responsibilities.
  - Mixed/shared responsibility over network/firewall, app settings, and authentication.

- **Cloud SaaS (e.g., Office 365)**:
  - Azure takes over network and app settings.
  - Mixed responsibility for authentication.

### Define Cloud Models (Public, Private, and Hybrid)
- **Public Cloud**:
  - Computing services offered by third-party providers over the public internet.
  - Azure owns the hardware, available to anyone with a credit card.

- **Private Cloud**:
  - Computing services offered over the internet or private internal network to select users.
  - Customer owns or leases exclusive access to hardware.
  - Government Network and Stack HCI.

- **Hybrid Cloud**:
  - Combines private and public cloud environments.
  - Example: SQL Stretch database for extra space.

- **High Availability (HA)**: System remains operational during planned or unplanned outages.
- **Scalability**: System can accommodate increasing demand by adding/removing resources as needed.
- **Elasticity**: Automatic adaptation to changing usage patterns.

#### Reliability and Predictability
- **Reliability**: System performs intended function without interruption.
- **Predictability**: Forecast and control system performance and behavior, including costs.

#### Security and Governance
- **Security**: Cloud providers go through security audits and compliance certifications.
- **Governance**: Defining, implementing, and monitoring policies guiding cloud operations.

#### Manageability
- **Manageability in the Cloud**: Templates, automation, scaling, monitoring, alerts, self-healing.
- **Manageability of the Cloud**: Web portal, CLI, scripts, APIs, PowerShell.

## Describe Cloud Service Types

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Essential services: computing, storage, network.
- Example: Azure Virtual Machine, Azure Storage, Virtual Networking.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Includes service layer, middleware, development tools, database server.
- Example: Azure App Services, Managed Storage.

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Centrally hosted and managed software.
- Example: Skype, Dropbox, Office 365.
